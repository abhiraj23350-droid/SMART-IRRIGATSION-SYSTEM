# SMART-IRRIGATSION-SYSTEM
🌱 SMART IRRIGATION SYSTEM USING ARDUINO
#🔹 Project Title

Automatic Smart Irrigation System Using Arduino and Soil Moisture Sensor

🔹 Project Aim

The aim of this project is to automatically water plants by detecting soil moisture level, so that water is saved and plants get water only when required.

🔹 Problem Statement

In traditional irrigation:

Plants are watered manually

Water is often wasted

Plants may be over-watered or under-watered

This system solves the problem by automatically turning ON/OFF the water pump based on soil moisture.

#🔹 Components Required

Arduino UNO – Main controller

Soil Moisture Sensor – Detects soil moisture level

Relay Module (1 Channel) – Acts as a switch for the pump

DC Water Pump – Supplies water to plants

Breadboard – For easy connections

Jumper Wires – For wiring

External Power Supply – For water pump

#🔹 Working Principle

Soil moisture sensor gives analog value to Arduino

Arduino checks whether soil is dry or wet

If soil is dry → Pump turns ON

If soil is wet → Pump turns OFF

If sensor is in air → Pump remains OFF (safety condition)

#🔹 Software Used

Arduino IDE

Programming Language: Embedded C / Arduino C

#🔹 Algorithm (Step-by-Step)

Start the system

Read soil moisture sensor value

If sensor is in air → Pump OFF

If soil is dry → Pump ON

If soil is wet → Pump OFF

Repeat continuously

#🔹 Applications

Home gardening

Agriculture fields

Greenhouses
